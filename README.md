# treadmill_photon

Previously, I [used](https://github.com/jonlorusso/treadmill) an Arduino (NG) to connect to my [Confidence Power Plus Treadmill](https://www.amazon.com/Confidence-Power-Motorized-Electric-Treadmill/dp/B004TGWUPE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1470797867&sr=8-1&keywords=confidence+power+plus).  This revised version instead embeds a [Particle Photon](https://store.particle.io/collections/photon) in the provided display/controller, reimplementing the stock code.
